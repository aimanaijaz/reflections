1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
  By using diff command I got the exact areas in the file that were changed.
Hence was able to spot the error.

2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?
  Help you find errors quickly

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
  Pros - More logical code
  Cons - Might forget to commit 

4)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  Because the files are inter-related.

5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
  Git log gives you the list of commits along with their ids. You can use these 
  ids with git diff to find out the number of insertions and deletions.

6)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  You are more confident because you know even if something breaks you will be able to fix it easily.
